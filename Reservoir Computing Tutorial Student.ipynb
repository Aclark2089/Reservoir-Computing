    "A reservoir is a high-dimensional dynamical system with the <b>fading memory</b> property. This property states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <i>The reservoir must have recurrent feedback such that the state of the network at any time reflects its past input history. In other words, the system must have a dynamical memory.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) <i>This memory must fade over time, such that the reservoir eventually forgets any initial conditions.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "This essential property allows input data to be projected into a high-dimensional function space containing contextual information about recent past inputs. The information within the reservoir can then be fed into a linear classifier, which uses linear combinations of these functions to perform the desired classification or prediction task."

    "Time-series prediction and classification are notoriously difficult, especially in real time. For example, let's say you want to track the motion of an object using a feed-forward neural network. In this case, not only would you need a set of N neurons to identify the object in a still image, you would need a separate set of N neurons for each additional time-frame relevant to the motion of the object. This could be tens or hundreds of frames! Essentially, what this is doing is representing time extrinsically, as an extra spatial dimension, which turns out to be very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more clever method is to use a recurrent neural network capable of capturing the true dynamics of the object being tracked. In this case, time is represented intrinsically rather than extrinsically. While they are extremely powerful, however, recurrent neural networks are notoriously difficult to train. The standard technique of backpropagation through time (BTT) often either fails completely or leads to excruciatingly slow learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where reservoir computing comes in. Instead of attempting to learn the weights of the recurrent neural network, we instead create a random network with macroscopic dynamics (i.e. time constants, length scales) similar to the system we're trying to model or predict. Then we train a feed-forward neural network to interpret the current state of the reservoir, which naturally contains information about its past inputs."
